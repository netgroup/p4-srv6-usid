The SRv6 "micro segment" (uSID for short) solution is an extension to the SRv6 Network
Programming model. It allows expressing SRv6 segments with a very compact and 
efficient representation, for example using two bytes for uSID instead of using
a normal IPv6 address (16 bytes) for a regular SRv6 segment. Our scientific papers on this topic
are listed [below](#scientific-papers).

In the context of the [ROSE](https://netgroup.github.io/rose/) project, we have 
implemented the SRv6 uSID solution using the [P4](https://www.opennetworking.org/p4/) [language](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials)
and realized a DEMO, illustrated in the following figure.

The demo runs on a mininet topology made up of eight P4 enabled switches (based on [bmv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) P4 software implementation) and two hosts that represent Site A and Site B. The source code and the detailed instruction to run the demo are reported below.
